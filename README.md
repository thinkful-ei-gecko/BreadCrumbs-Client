# Live App: [Breadcrumbs News Aggregator](https://breadcrumbs.now.sh/)  

# Demo Account => Username: demo, Password: pass

## Project Description:  

Breadcrumbs is a reenvisioned news aggregator that eliminates "gatekeepers" and the inevitable partisanship found on older platforms that rely on editors and manual aggregation.  By empowering our users to anonymously determine an article's value, we have created a decentralized auditing system over which the users have total control.  This decentralized system will affect the visibility of each automatically submitted article, with more valuable articles rising to the top of the user's feed.  Every 15 minutes Breadcrumbs will feed fresh news from over 30,000 unique online publishers for its users to read, evaluate, archive, and publicly discuss.

# User stories

#### 1.)  As an informed citizen, I want to be able to review news from wide variety of sources without bias or partisan filtering.  

-   No central point of content control.
-   News from as many sources as possible.
-   A constant stream of new articles, regardless of the time or day of the week.


#### 2.)  I'm interested in information, not clickbait or vapid articles.

-   Users can quickly preview the article, and not just rely on the article's title or editor's tagline.
-   Users can see the source of each article.
-   Users can view the author's name.
-   If interested in the article, users can click to view the complete article in a new tab.


#### 3.)  I am a believer in the power of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).  As such, I would like to  see a method for user to be able to determine the visibility/popularity of content with organic unincentivized user voting.

- Users can select articles from the API stream to submit to their peers for voting in the Oven.
- Normal articles will not be able to be voted on, in case someone doesn't want to join in on the social aspect.
- Voting is not rewarded, thus keeping it honest.
- Users can add value or subtract value from articles.


#### 4.) If I have limited time or do not feel like contributing to the DAO voting system, I would like to be able to view articles that are currently highly rated by my peers.


- Users can, at any time, view the current hierarchy of user voted articles.
- Articles with the most positive vote totals should be the most visible.


#### 5.)  If I am interested in a specific subject, I would like to be able to hone or filter my results without penalty.

- Users can view articles by subject matter at any time.
- Users can continue to use the DAO voting system while filtering results.


#### 6.) As a user who has unique insight and opinions, I would like to be able to interact with other users in a social manner.

- User commenting on articles.
- User voting on posted comments.
- Users comments are NOT anonymous, but votes are.


#### 7.) If I find an article that I want to access at a later date, I should be able to save it.

- Users can archive articles permanently.
- Archived articles are user specific, and thus private.
- Archived articles can be removed from the user's list.
- Archived articles do not display vote values. In this case the opinion of the users peers is inconsequential.


#### 8.)  As a user who values privacy, I want total control over my account.

- Users can change their public facing name/handle.
- Users can change their login information (username and password).
- Users can permanently delete their account.
